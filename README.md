**Answers**


**Dart & Flutter:**

1. **B) Download the Dart SDK**
   - This is the correct first step because you need to download the Dart SDK from the official Dart website to install Dart on a Windows machine.

2. **C) dart --version**
   - Running `dart --version` on macOS verifies the Dart installation by displaying the installed Dart version. This command checks if Dart is correctly installed and accessible via the command line.

3. **B) Update your PATH**
   - After downloading and extracting the Flutter SDK on Linux, updating your PATH is the next step. This ensures your system can locate the Flutter binaries for use in the command line.

4. **C) flutter run**
   - Use `flutter run` to run a newly created Flutter app. This command compiles the Flutter project and deploys it to an attached device or emulator for testing and development.

**Python Installation:**

1. **B) Download Python from the official website**
   - The first step to install Python on a Windows system is to download Python from the official website. This ensures you have the correct installer for your system.

2. **C) Add Python to PATH**
   - During Python installation on Windows, you should ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked to make Python accessible from the command line without needing to specify its full path.

3. **A) By running python --version**
   - Verifying Python installation on any system can be done by running `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt. This command displays the installed Python version if Python is correctly installed and configured.

4. **C) curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py**
   - This command is used to install pip on macOS and Linux. It downloads a Python script (`get-pip.py`) and executes it to install pip, the package installer for Python.

5. **C) To separate project dependencies and avoid conflicts**
   - The purpose of a virtual environment in Python is to isolate project dependencies. This allows different projects to use different sets of libraries and avoids conflicts between dependencies of different projects.

**MySQL Installation:**

1. **B) Download MySQL Installer from the official website**
   - The first step to install MySQL on Windows is to download the MySQL Installer from the official MySQL website. This installer includes all necessary components for MySQL installation.

2. **D) Custom**
   - For a custom MySQL installation, you should choose the "Custom" setup type. This allows you to select specific MySQL products and features tailored to your needs.

3. **A) MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Shell**
   - During MySQL installation, you should select MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Shell. These products together provide a comprehensive MySQL environment for development and administration.

4. **B) To secure your MySQL installation with a super-secret password**
   - Setting a root password during MySQL installation is crucial for securing your MySQL installation. It helps protect your database server from unauthorized access and ensures only authorized users can administer MySQL.

5. **B) Launch MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL Server**
   - After installing MySQL, you begin managing your database by launching MySQL Workbench and connecting to your MySQL Server. MySQL Workbench provides a graphical interface for managing databases, executing queries, and performing administrative tasks.
